            After losing $200 of his hard-earned savings, 19-year old Developer
            Kurt Jacob Urquico was tired of dealing with unreliable service from
            overseas puzzle retailers. His dream opens the first speedcubing and
            twisty puzzle shop in the PHILIPPINES with a mission to provide (and
            surpass) the kind of service that he expects as a customer. In 2020,
            Kurt's dream became a reality and D' QUBE SHOP opened with a modest
            selection of products. Today, D' QUBE SHOP is the Philippines most
            trusted retailer and is continuing to grow while staying true to the
            company's core values.
